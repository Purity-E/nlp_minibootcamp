## Step 1
Text processing
- Normalize the document by removing non-alphabetical and non-numerical characters
- Removing stop words
- Lemmatizing the document
## Step2
Text Representation/Encoding & Feature Engineering
- Used CountVectorizer for encoding the data
## Step 3
Modeling
Built 3 Machine Learning models
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forest
## Step 4
Evaluation
